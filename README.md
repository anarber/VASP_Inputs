# VASP_Inputs
Python code to generate VASP input files using Pymatgen

Each python file can be run separately to generate the input files required to run a VASP calculation. Required files include a POSCAR for the structure of interest and folder containing VASP pseudopotentials to create the POTCAR. Make sure Pymatgen has access to the pseudopotentials by following the instructions at https://pymatgen.org/installation.html#potcar-setup.
