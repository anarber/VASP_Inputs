# VASP_Inputs
Python codes to generate VASP input files using Pymatgen. These codes are designed to help new VASP users improve their workflow. 

Each python script can be run separately to generate the input files required to run a VASP calculation. Required files include a POSCAR for the structure of interest and a folder containing VASP pseudopotentials to create the POTCAR. Make sure Pymatgen has access to the pseudopotentials by following the instructions at https://pymatgen.org/installation.html#potcar-setup.
